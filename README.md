# LN ⚡ CHAT

## What would chatting on the Lightning Network look like? 🤔?
[ x ] Lightning-fast messaging
[x] Invoice creation and payment 
[x] Instantly send and receive Sats from users on your contact list
[x] Track your transactions and get notified of new payments
[x] And the best part is you can choose to be anonymous (more or less pseudonymous)


# This is the frontend half of the LN⚡CHAT project.
