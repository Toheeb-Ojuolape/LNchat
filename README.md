## What would chatting on the Lightning Network look like? 🤔?
- [x] Lightning-fast messaging
- [x] Invoice creation and payment 
- [x] Instantly send and receive Sats from users on your contact list
- [x] Track your transactions and get notified of new payments
- [x] And the best part is you can choose to be anonymous (more or less pseudonymous)
